## This is a sample of some of the small projects I have been working on.

## Audio Player

```
   This project uses the audio API and some CSS tricks.
```

## BlogApp

```
   My first project using the MEN stack (mongoDB, nodeJS, express).
```

## Exchange Rate Calculator

```
   Uses Fetch API to get exchange rates.
```

## Expense Tracker

```
   This expense tracker uses local storage. You have to put in a negative sign in front of values which are expenses in order for it to work. Uses DOM array methods like filter(), map() and reduce().
```

## Hangman Game

```
   A very basic hangman game. I plan on using Fetch API generate random words, but haven't implemented this as yet.
```

## Speech Text Reader

```
   This is a simple version of a text reader that can be used by kids with speech impairments. It uses the web speech API (speech synthesis).
```
